##Goal

To give victims of MLM companies a chance to fight back. Hopefully, the end goal of this app is to help some of these companies driven by greed to fall.


##How it works

Donators chose which company they want to donate against. That money goes into a collective fund used against that MLM Company.


The Victims are currently apart of the company. They have the best advantages to get someone out of the company because they know whose in the company.
They will try to get others out of the company and have them tell there stories. To incentivize them to get more people out of those companies, they
will recieve some ammount of the collection fund(%5), and also the person they get out will be ($5).

I need a way to try to figure out how we can show our donators that people have left the company through they're donations.
